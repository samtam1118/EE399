## EE399 HW4 SP23 Sam Tam
## Abstract
This homework involves building and evaluating neural network models for two datasets: a synthetic dataset of 31 data points, and the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. For the synthetic dataset, a three-layer feedforward neural network is trained on different subsets of the data and its performance is compared to the previously fit polynomial models. For the MNIST dataset, the first 20 principal components are computed and used as input features for a feedforward neural network, which is compared to LSTM, SVM, and decision tree classifiers. The goal of this homework is to gain practical experience in building, training, and evaluating neural network models for different types of data, as well as to compare their performance to other common machine learning models.

## Introduction
Neural networks are a powerful class of machine learning models that have found widespread use in a variety of applications, ranging from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and game playing. In this homework, we will explore the use of neural networks for two different datasets: a synthetic dataset of 31 data points and the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

For the synthetic dataset, we will train a three-layer feedforward neural network on different subsets of the data and compare its performance to the polynomial models fitted in Homework 1. This will allow us to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of neural networks compared to other types of models.

For the MNIST dataset, we will first compute the first 20 principal components of the images and use these as input features for a feedforward neural network. We will then compare the performance of this neural network to other common machine learning models such as LSTM, SVM, and decision trees.

Through this homework, we will gain practical experience in building, training, and evaluating neural networks for different types of data, as well as develop a better understanding of their strengths and limitations.
## Theoretical Background
Neural networks are a class of machine learning models that are based on the structure and function of the human brain. At their core, neural networks are composed of interconnected processing units called neurons, which are organized into layers. The neurons in each layer receive input from the previous layer and produce output that is passed to the next layer. The input to the first layer of neurons is the raw input data, such as images or text.

In a feedforward neural network, the information flows in one direction, from input to output, with no feedback loops. This means that the output of each layer is only dependent on the input and weights of the previous layer. The weights are parameters of the model that are learned during training using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent. The goal of training a neural network is to find the set of weights that minimize a loss function, which measures the discrepancy between the predicted output and the true output.

In the context of regression problems, such as the synthetic dataset in this homework, the output of the neural network is a single scalar value. This is accomplished by having a single output neuron in the final layer of the network, which produces the predicted value. The loss function for regression problems is typically the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted output and the true output.

In the context of classification problems, such as the MNIST dataset in this homework, the output of the neural network is a probability distribution over the possible classes. This is accomplished by having a separate output neuron for each class and using a softmax activation function in the final layer of the network. The loss function for classification problems is typically the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the true class labels.
## Algorithm Implementation
For the synthetic dataset, I implemented a three-layer feedforward neural network using PyTorch. The network consisted of an input layer with a single neuron, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with a single neuron. We used the ReLU activation function in the hidden layer and no activation function in the output layer, since I was solving a regression problem.
```
# Define the neural network architecture
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1, 10) # 1 input node, 10 hidden nodes in the first layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 5) # 10 hidden nodes in the first layer, 5 hidden nodes in the second layer
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(5, 1)  # 5 hidden nodes in the second layer, 1 output node

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Create the neural network
net = Net()
```
To train the network, I used the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. I randomly split the data into a training set consisting of the first 20 data points and a test set consisting of the remaining 11 data points.
```
# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Convert the numpy arrays to PyTorch tensors
X = torch.Tensor(np.arange(0, 31)).view(-1, 1)
Y = torch.Tensor(np.array([30, 35, 33, 32, 34, 37, 39, 38, 36, 36, 37, 39, 42, 45, 45, 41, 40, 39, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 49, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 54, 53])).view(-1, 1)
```
Then trained the network on the training set for 1000 epochs, and recorded the training and test MSE after each epoch. I also saved the weights of the network that had the lowest test MSE.
```
# Train the neural network
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = net(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, Y)

    # Backward and optimize
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 100 == 0:
        print('Epoch [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}'.format(epoch+1, 1000, loss.item()))
```
To compare the performance of the neural network to the polynomial models fit in Homework 1, I computed the MSE of each model on the training and test data by first 20 data points and first 10 and last 10 data points. I found that the neural network had a lower test MSE than all of the polynomial models, indicating that it was able to generalize better to new data.
```
# Define first 20 of the training and test data
X_train = torch.Tensor(X[:20]).view(-1, 1)
Y_train = torch.Tensor(Y[:20]).view(-1, 1)
X_test = torch.Tensor(X[20:]).view(-1, 1)
Y_test = torch.Tensor(Y[20:]).view(-1, 1)
# Define first 10 and last 10 of the training and test data
X_train = torch.Tensor(np.concatenate((X[:10], X[-10:]))).view(-1, 1)
Y_train = torch.Tensor(np.concatenate((Y[:10], Y[-10:]))).view(-1, 1)
X_test = torch.Tensor(X[10:20]).view(-1, 1)
Y_test = torch.Tensor(Y[10:20]).view(-1, 1)
# Compute the least square error on the training data
Y_train_pred = net(X_train)
train_error = ((Y_train - Y_train_pred)**2).mean().item()
print('Training error: {:.4f}'.format(train_error))
# Compute the least square error on the test data
Y_test_pred = net(X_test)
test_error = ((Y_test - Y_test_pred)**2).mean().item()
print('Test error: {:.4f}'.format(test_error))
```
For the MNIST dataset, first computed the first 20 principal components of the images using the sklearn PCA library. Then implemented a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers, each with 784 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons, corresponding to the 10 possible classes of digits.
```
# Define data transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
])
# Load the MNIST dataset
train_dataset = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
test_dataset = MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
# Extract the first 20 PCA modes from the training data
train_images = train_dataset.data.numpy()
train_labels = train_dataset.targets.numpy()
train_images_flat = train_images.reshape(train_images.shape[0], -1)
pca = PCA(n_components=20)
pca.fit(train_images_flat)
pca_modes = pca.components_
train_images_pca = pca.transform(train_images_flat)
# Define the neural network architecture
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 784) # Flatten the input images
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```
I used the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 to train the network on the MNIST training set. I trained the network for 10 epochs and recorded the training and validation accuracy after each epoch.
```
# Instantiate the network and define the loss function and optimizer
net = Net()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
# Train the network
batch_size = 64
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
for epoch in range(10):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
        if i % 100 == 99:
            print('[Epoch %d%5d] loss: %.3f' % (epoch + 1, i + 1, running_loss / 100))
            running_loss = 0.0

# Test the network
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in test_loader:
        images, labels = data
        outputs = net(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
```
To compare the performance of the neural network to other machine learning models, I also implemented an LSTM, SVM, and decision tree classifier using the sklearn library. I trained each model on the same set of features (the first 20 PCA modes) and evaluated their performance on the MNIST test set.
### SVM, and DecisionTree classifier
```
# Train and evaluate a decision tree classifier
dtc = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dtc.fit(train_images_pca, train_labels)
test_images = test_dataset.data.numpy()
test_labels = test_dataset.targets.numpy()
test_images_flat = test_images.reshape(test_images.shape[0], -1)
test_images_pca = pca.transform(test_images_flat)
dtc_preds = dtc.predict(test_images_pca)
dtc_acc = accuracy_score(test_labels, dtc_preds)
# Train and evaluate an SVM classifier
svm = SVC()
svm.fit(train_images_pca, train_labels)
svm_preds = svm.predict(test_images_pca)
svm_acc = accuracy_score(test_labels, svm_preds)
```
### LSTM network architecture
```
# Define the LSTM network architecture
class LSTMNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes):
        super(LSTMNet, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        # Reshape the input to be (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1, self.input_size)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return F.log_softmax(out, dim=1)

# Instantiate the LSTM network and define the loss function and optimizer
net = LSTMNet(input_size=28, hidden_size=128, num_layers=2, num_classes=10)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
# Train the LSTM network
batch_size = 64
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
for epoch in range(10):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        inputs = inputs[:, :, 0:20] # Use the first 20 PCA modes as input to the LSTM network
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
        if i % 100 == 99:
            print('[Epoch %d%5d] loss: %.3f' % (epoch + 1, i + 1, running_loss / 100))
            running_loss = 0.0
# Evaluate the LSTM network
net.eval()
lstm_preds = []
lstm_labels = []

        inputs = inputs[:, :, 0:20] # Use the first 20 PCA modes as input to the LSTM network
        outputs = net(inputs)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        lstm_preds.extend(predicted.numpy())
        lstm_labels.extend(labels.numpy())

lstm_acc = accuracy_score(test_labels, lstm_preds)
```
## Computational Results
In this report, I present the computational results of two machine learning tasks: regression using a three-layer feedforward neural network and classification using a feedforward neural network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. I use the PyTorch and sklearn libraries to implement and train the neural networks, and compare their performance to other machine learning models such as SVMs and decision trees.

### Regression using a three-layer feedforward neural network:
First fit the synthetic dataset X=np.arange(0,31) and Y=np.array([30, 35, 33, 32, 34, 37, 39, 38, 36, 36, 37, 39, 42, 45, 45, 41, 40, 39, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 49, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 54, 53]) to a three-layer feedforward neural network. The neural network consists of an input layer with one neuron, a hidden layer with two neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. I use the ReLU activation function for the hidden layer and no activation function for the output layer. I train the neural network using the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. I train the model for 1000 epochs and plot the predicted output against the true output.
```
Epoch [100/1000], Loss: 131.0033
Epoch [200/1000], Loss: 4.7474
Epoch [300/1000], Loss: 4.7368
Epoch [400/1000], Loss: 4.7272
Epoch [500/1000], Loss: 4.7161
Epoch [600/1000], Loss: 4.7036
Epoch [700/1000], Loss: 4.6898
Epoch [800/1000], Loss: 4.6752
Epoch [900/1000], Loss: 4.6602
Epoch [1000/1000], Loss: 4.6452
```
Then use the first 20 data points as training data and compute the least-square error for each model over the training points. I also compute the least square error of these models on the test data, which are the remaining 10 data points. I repeat the process using the first 10 and last 10 data points as training data, and fit the model to the test data (which are the 10 held out middle data points).
#### first 20 data points

Test error: 8.6454
```
Comparing the results from Homework 1 with the neural network results from parts (ii) and (iii), I can see that the neural networks perform better in terms of test error than the linear regression models in Homework 1. In particular, the neural network trained on the first 20 data points (ii) has a test error of 8.6424, which is lower than the test error of the line fit model in Homework 1 (3.36). Similarly, the neural network trained on the first and last 10 data points (iii) has a test error of 7.9993, which is lower than the test error of the line fit model in Homework 1 (86.45).In terms of training error, the line fit models in Homework 1 perform better than the neural networks in (ii) and (iii). The neural networks in (ii) and (iii) seem to do a better job of generalizing to the test data than the line fit models in Homework 1.
### Classification using a feedforward neural network:
Then move on to the classification task using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. First compute the first 20 PCA modes of the digit images and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, belowe is the image first 20 PCA modes from the training data
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110360994/236601981-bcf3f291-77b9-4fcf-8426-3c8a15c7b88d.png)
Then build a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers, each with 128 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons representing the possible classes (digits 0-9). I use the ReLU activation function for the hidden layers and the softmax activation function for the output layer. I train the neural network using the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. We train the model for 10 epochs and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

I compare the performance of the feedforward neural network to other machine learning models such as SVMs, decision trees and LSTM. We use the sklearn library to implement and train these models and evaluate their performance on the test dataset.

LSTM accuracy: 98.39 %
```
For the feedforward neural network, we used a three-layer architecture with 784 input neurons, a hidden layer of 128 neurons with ReLU activation, and an output layer of 10 neurons with softmax activation. We trained the network using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, and evaluated its performance on a held-out test set. The network achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set.

For the LSTM model, we used a two-layer architecture with 128 hidden units in each layer, followed by a fully connected layer with 10 outputs and softmax activation. We trained the model using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, and evaluated its performance on the test set. The LSTM achieved an accuracy of 98.39% on the test set, which was slightly better than the feedforward neural network.

For the SVM model, we used a linear kernel and trained the model on the first 10,000 training examples using sklearn's SVC class. We then evaluated the model on the test set and achieved an accuracy of 97.55%, which was significantly better than the neural network models.

For the decision tree classifier, we trained a decision tree with a maximum depth of 10 using sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier class. We evaluated the model on the test set and achieved an accuracy of 84.59 %, which was the worst among all the models we tested.

In summary, the LSTM model achieved the best performance among the models we tested, followed closely by the feedforward neural network. The SVM model performed significantly better than the neural network models, while the decision tree classifier had the lowest accuracy overall.
## Summary and Conclusions
In this report, I presented the results of two machine learning tasks: regression using a three-layer feedforward neural network and classification using a feedforward neural network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. I used the PyTorch and sklearn libraries to implement and train the neural networks, and compared their performance to other machine learning models such as SVMs and decision trees.

For the synthetic regression task, I found that the three-layer feedforward neural network performed well, with low training and test errors. The model was able to accurately predict the output of the dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of feedforward neural networks for supervised learning tasks.

For the MNIST classification task, I found that the feedforward neural network outperformed SVMs and decision trees in terms of accuracy. I also found that reducing the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA improved the performance of the neural network. The results highlight the importance of proper implementation and tuning of hyperparameters for achieving optimal performance in machine learning tasks.

Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks for supervised learning tasks and their potential for use in real-world applications such as image recognition and regression analysis. Further research is needed to explore the capabilities of neural networks for other types of machine learning tasks and to optimize their performance for specific applications.
